- Follow the [GenHub Coding Style Guide](coding-style.md).
- Use 4-space indentation.
- Always use braces for control blocks.
- Prefer fluent LINQ syntax.
- Enable and use nullable reference types.
- Use primary constructors where appropriate.
- Maintain strict ordering of class members and using directives.

---

## Pull Requests

- Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
- Provide a clear, descriptive title and summary.
- Reference related issues (e.g., `Fixes #123`).
- Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
- Pass all CI checks before requesting review.
- Be responsive to feedback and requested changes.

---

## Issue Reporting

- Search existing issues before opening a new one.
- Provide detailed steps to reproduce bugs.
- Include logs, screenshots, or error messages if relevant.
- Use clear, descriptive titles.

---

## Feature Requests

- Clearly describe the proposed feature and its benefits.
- Include use cases or examples where possible.
- Be open to discussion and feedback from maintainers and the community.

---

## Code Review

- All PRs must be reviewed by at least one maintainer before merging.
- Anyone can review, but maintainers will have the final say on merging.
- Reviewers will check for code quality, adherence to style, and test coverage.
- Be clear and constructive in your feedback.
- Larger changes may require multiple rounds of review.
- Be patient; maintainers may have other commitments.
- If you disagree with feedback, discuss it respectfully and provide your reasoning.
- When you approve a PR, please leave it open for at least 24 hours (or until another maintainer has had a chance to review) before merging. This gives others an opportunity to provide input and helps catch issues earlier.
