                    GenHub simplifies playing, modding, and managing Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour.

                    **Core Concepts:**
                    * **Isolated Profiles:** Each game profile is completely separated from your base game installation.
                    * **Zero-Copy Workspaces:** Filesystem linking allows mods to run without duplicating gigabytes of files on your drive.
                    * **Central Content Library:** Downloaded mods, custom maps, and community patches are stored once and shared across any number of profiles.
                    * **Community Integration:** Native support for Generals Online, TheSuperHackers modern engine, and official Steam releases.

                    **Why normalization is necessary**
                    GenLauncher modifies files directly inside the game directory when activating and deactivating mods. It renames active `.big` files to `.gib` to scramble them, appends `.GLR` (replaced files), `.GOF` (original file backups), and `.GLTC` (temporary copies) suffixes, and creates stray symbolic links. Importing a directory left in this state prevents the game engine from reading mod archives.

                    **Automated normalization in GenHub**
                    When you select a folder or archive containing GenLauncher files, GenHub's normalization service identifies these artifacts automatically during staging:

                    1. Renames all scrambled `.gib` archives back to standard `.big` files so the game engine can mount them.
                    2. Strips `.GLR`, `.GOF`, and `.GLTC` suffixes to restore standard file names.
                    3. Cleans up broken or invalid symbolic links left by previous installations.

                    Normalization runs safely in the staging area before registration, ensuring your imported content item contains clean standard assets.

             * **Self-Healing URL Migration:** Contains permanent definitionUrl and previousDefinitionUrls. When hosting moves (e.g. Google Drive to Cloudflare R2), client launchers automatically heal subscription endpoints.
             * **Hosting Rule:** Tier 1 URLs must remain permanent and update in-place when metadata or catalog links change.

             **2. Tier 2: Content Catalogs (catalog-*.json)**

             **3. Tier 3: Artifact Archives (*.zip, .big)**
             * **Immutable Binary Payloads:** The actual mod archives, map packs, executables, or data files installed by players.
             * **Zero Mutation Guarantee:** Every release or patch produces a new immutable download URL and SHA-256 hash. Older artifact archives must never be overwritten or deleted from the CDN, ensuring rollbacks and dependency resolution never break.

             * **Link Availability:** Publishers are entirely responsible for hosting bandwidth and link availability. If an external file URL expires, is removed, or exceeds quota, player downloads will fail until an updated catalog is published.
             * **Retaining Old Versions:** Players can lock profiles to specific versions or roll back updates. Older Tier 3 artifact archives must remain permanently accessible on your storage provider.
             * **Mirror Redundancy:** Manifests support secondary mirror URLs (mirrors: [...]). Publishers can declare fallback endpoints (e.g. GitHub Releases primary with Google Drive or Dropbox mirrors) for maximum reliability.

             **Supported Hosting Providers:**
             * **Google Drive:** Integrated OAuth 2.0. Publisher Studio creates a GenHub_Publisher folder and uses Files.Update to keep Tier 1 and 2 file IDs stable while uploading new Tier 3 archives.

             * Subscriptions are tracked locally in subscriptions.json, where players can toggle individual catalogs on or off.

             **2. Periodic Background Polling:**
             * The hosted PublisherCatalogUpdateService runs in the background (every 30 minutes and on launcher startup).

             * **SemVer Evaluation:** IContentStateService compares installed package versions in CAS against the latest release version in the catalog.
             * **Actionable Notifications:** When a newer SemVer is discovered, the item state transitions to ContentState.UpdateAvailable. GenHub dispatches an in-app desktop notification with release notes and displays an 'Update Available' badge on the content card in the Downloads tab.
             * **Instant Rollbacks:** Clicking Update downloads the new Tier 3 artifact into local Content Addressable Storage (CAS). Previous versions are retained, allowing instant rollbacks at any time from Profile Settings.

                    **How Workspaces Work:**
                    When you click Play, GenHub instantly prepares a dedicated workspace folder for that specific profile.

                    **Key Benefits:**
                    1. **Zero Extra Disk Space:** In linked modes (HardLink and SymlinkOnly), the workspace functions as a complete multi-gigabyte game folder while consuming virtually 0 MB of extra disk space.
                    2. **Complete Profile Isolation:** Mods and configurations live in dedicated profile workspaces. Your main game directory remains untouched, so files never get mixed up. (For mods that modify game binaries in-place, select Hybrid or Full Copy mode).
                    3. **Instant Switching:** Switch between large total conversions like *Rise of the Reds* and *ShockWave* in seconds without reinstalling or moving files.

                    **Choosing the Right Strategy:**
                    GenHub supports four file linking strategies under **Settings -> Game Configuration**:

                    * **HardLink (Default & Recommended):**
                        * *How it works:* Creates direct filesystem pointers (hard links) on the same drive. Across different drives, it uses symbolic links; if symlink creation fails, workspace preparation fails. Select **FullCopy** instead.
                        * *Disk Space:* **0 bytes** extra storage (requires the same drive).
                        * *Speed:* Instant (< 50ms) on the same volume.
                        * *Privileges:* No administrator privileges or Developer Mode required on the same drive. Cross-drive symbolic link fallback has the same requirements as SymlinkOnly.
                        * *Recommendation:* Keep your workspaces and game installation on the **same drive** (e.g. both on `C:` or both on `D:`) for optimal zero-space performance.

                    * **SymlinkOnly:**
                        * *How it works:* Creates symbolic links pointing to source files and directories.
                        * *Disk Space:* **Negligible** (~a few KB of link pointers).
                        * *Speed:* Instant (< 50ms).
                        * *Advantage:* Links seamlessly across **different drives and partitions**.
                        * *Requirement:* On Windows, requires **Administrator rights** or **Developer Mode** enabled in Windows Settings.

                    * **HybridCopySymlink (Balanced Compatibility):**
                        * *How it works:* Copies essential engine files, scripts, and configuration files into the workspace while symlinking large media files (textures, audio, and video).
                        * *Disk Space:* Balanced footprint (copies key configs, links media).
                        * *Speed:* Fast (1-2 seconds).
                        * *Advantage:* Protects configuration files from cross-profile conflicts while keeping disk usage low.

                    * **FullCopy (Universal Fallback):**
                        * *How it works:* Physically copies every game and mod file into the workspace directory.
                        * *Disk Space:* Uses the full game size (**2-5+ GB** per profile).
                        * *Speed:* Slower (10-30+ seconds depending on drive speed).
                        * *Advantage:* Maximum compatibility across external drives, network drives, and restricted environments.

                    **How Linking Works Under the Hood:**

                    * **Hardlink:**
                        A hardlink points directly to the existing file data on disk at the filesystem level. Because the underlying file data is shared, creating a hardlink takes zero extra storage. Hardlinks must reside on the same drive partition as the original file.

                    * **Symlink (Symbolic Link):**
                        A symlink is a lightweight pointer that stores a path to the target file or folder, similar to a transparent operating system shortcut. Symlinks can cross different drives, but Windows security policies require elevated privileges or Developer Mode to create them.

                    * **Full Copy:**
                        A complete duplicate of the file written to a new location on disk.

                    **Automatic Fallback:**
                    If you configure Symlink mode but run GenHub without administrator rights or Developer Mode, GenHub automatically falls back to hardlinks when files reside on the same drive, ensuring your game launches without interruption.

                        * Alternatively, switch your Default Workspace Strategy to **HardLink** in GenHub Settings when the game and workspace use the same drive.
                    * **Cross-Drive Linking & Storage:**
                        * Hardlinks require both the game files and workspace to be on the same drive volume. Across different drives, **HardLink** uses symbolic links; if symlink creation fails, workspace preparation fails. Select **FullCopy** instead.
                        * To keep workspaces fast and zero-space, place your CAS pool and workspace directories on the same drive as your game installation in **Settings -> Data Directories**, or enable Developer Mode for symlinks.
                    * **"File In Use" / Locked File Warnings:**

             Every manifest carries a Manifest ID (such as 1.0.shockwave.mod.shockwave-chaos-edition) plus a human-readable name and version. Publishers sign releases with SHA-256 hashes so GenHub can verify every byte before installing.

             When you install, GenHub resolves the full ContentManifest: exact files, SHA-256 hashes, dependencies, and version constraints.

             Reconciliation maps pooled files into an isolated workspace using hardlinks, symlinks, or copies, then launches the game against that workspace.
