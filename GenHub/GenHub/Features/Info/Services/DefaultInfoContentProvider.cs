                    The base game files (Generals or Zero Hour) installed on your system. Every profile uses a client as its base foundation.

                    **Mod:**
                    A major modification changing gameplay, factions, and units (e.g. Rise of the Reds, ShockWave). A profile typically centers around one primary mod.

                    **Map:**
                    An individual custom map file for skirmish and multiplayer battles.

                    **Map Pack:**
                    A bundled collection of maps. Using a map pack lets you toggle an entire tournament pool or custom map collection with a single checkbox.

                    **Patch:**
                    An engine or system-level enhancement that improves stability (such as the 4GB Memory Patch or GenTool).

                    **Addon:**
                    Supplementary visual or audio packs (such as remastered music or HD textures) that sit on top of mods safely.

                    **Why normalization is necessary**
                    GenLauncher modifies files directly inside the game directory when activating and deactivating mods. It renames active `.big` files to `.gib` to scramble them, appends `.GLR` (replaced files), `.GOF` (original file backups), and `.GLTC` (temporary copies) suffixes, and creates stray symbolic links. Importing a directory left in this state prevents the game engine from reading mod archives.

                    **Automated normalization in GenHub**
                    When you select a folder or archive containing GenLauncher files, GenHub's normalization service identifies these artifacts automatically during staging:

                    1. Renames all scrambled `.gib` archives back to standard `.big` files so the game engine can mount them.
                    2. Strips `.GLR`, `.GOF`, and `.GLTC` suffixes to restore standard file names.
                    3. Cleans up broken or invalid symbolic links left by previous installations.

                    Normalization runs safely in the staging area before registration, ensuring your imported content item contains clean standard assets.

                    * Enable the checkbox next to any mod, addon, tool, or map pack to attach it to that profile.

                    3.  **Instant Switching:** Switch between large total conversions like *Rise of the Reds* and *ShockWave* in seconds without reinstalling or moving files.

                    **Choosing the Right Strategy:**
                    GenHub supports four file linking strategies under **Settings -> Game Configuration**:

                    *   **HardLink (Default & Recommended):**
                        *   *How it works:* Creates direct filesystem pointers (hard links) on the same drive. If your workspace and game files are on different drives, GenHub automatically falls back to copying files.
                        *   *Disk Space:* **0 bytes** extra storage when on the same drive (copies if across different drives).
                        *   *Speed:* Instant (< 50ms) on the same volume.
                        *   *Privileges:* No administrator privileges or Developer Mode required.
                        *   *Recommendation:* Keep your workspaces and game installation on the **same drive** (e.g. both on `C:` or both on `D:`) for optimal zero-space performance.

                    *   **SymlinkOnly:**
                        *   *How it works:* Creates symbolic links pointing to source files and directories.
                        *   *Disk Space:* **Negligible** (~a few KB of link pointers).
                        *   *Speed:* Instant (< 50ms).
                        *   *Advantage:* Links seamlessly across **different drives and partitions**.
                        *   *Requirement:* On Windows, requires **Administrator rights** or **Developer Mode** enabled in Windows Settings.

                    *   **HybridCopySymlink (Balanced Compatibility):**
                        *   *How it works:* Copies essential engine files, scripts, and configuration files into the workspace while symlinking large media files (textures, audio, and video).
                        *   *Disk Space:* Balanced footprint (copies key configs, links media).
                        *   *Speed:* Fast (1-2 seconds).
                        *   *Advantage:* Protects configuration files from cross-profile conflicts while keeping disk usage low.

                    *   **FullCopy (Universal Fallback):**
                        *   *How it works:* Physically copies every game and mod file into the workspace directory.
                        *   *Disk Space:* Uses the full game size (**2-5+ GB** per profile).
                        *   *Speed:* Slower (10-30+ seconds depending on drive speed).
                        *   *Advantage:* Maximum compatibility across external drives, network drives, and restricted environments.

                    **How Linking Works Under the Hood:**

                    *   **Hardlink:**
                        A hardlink points directly to the existing file data on disk at the filesystem level. Because the underlying file data is shared, creating a hardlink takes zero extra storage. Hardlinks must reside on the same drive partition as the original file.

                    *   **Symlink (Symbolic Link):**
                        A symlink is a lightweight pointer that stores a path to the target file or folder, similar to a transparent operating system shortcut. Symlinks can cross different drives, but Windows security policies require elevated privileges or Developer Mode to create them.

                    *   **Full Copy:**
                        A complete duplicate of the file written to a new location on disk.

                    **Automatic Fallback:**
                    If you configure Symlink mode but run GenHub without administrator rights or Developer Mode, GenHub automatically falls back to hardlinks when files reside on the same drive, ensuring your game launches without interruption.

                        *   Hardlinks require both the game files and workspace to be on the same drive volume to achieve zero-space linking. If they are on different drives, GenHub falls back to copying files.
                        *   To keep workspaces fast and zero-space, place your CAS pool and workspace directories on the same drive as your game installation in **Settings -> Data Directories**, or enable Developer Mode for symlinks.
                    *   **"File In Use" / Locked File Warnings:**

Click Allow to enable online connectivity."),
            ("What are connection relays?", "Relays route traffic when direct peer-to-peer connections are blocked.", InfoCardType.Concept, "If two players have strict firewalls that prevent direct peer-to-peer connection, traffic routes seamlessly through community relay servers (similar to Steam networking or CNCNet tunnels)."),
            ("Do relays cause lag or performance drops?", "Typically no. Relays use high-bandwidth, low-latency backbone servers.", InfoCardType.Concept, "Relay servers are hosted on high-speed backbones and often provide comparable or better latency than congested direct peer-to-peer routes."),
            ("How does the game select which relay to use?", "Relay connections are formed dynamically on a player-to-player basis.", InfoCardType.Feature, "Relay connections are established dynamically per player pair, selecting the server location with the lowest latency for that match. Users in the same lobby can connect through different regional edge nodes to achieve optimal ping."),
