/// in isolation; this proves the wiring — handler, drain, buffer and error message —
/// actually delivers them to the caller.

/// It does <b>not</b> deterministically pin the end-of-stream drain. Removing the

/// handlers happen to complete before the capture is read even at twenty thousand lines.
/// The drain is retained on the documented contract — the parameterless overload waits
/// for redirected-output handlers, the timed ones do not — rather than on a failing test
/// here. A platform with different scheduling may well expose it.
