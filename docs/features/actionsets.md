# ActionSet Fixes

This document provides comprehensive documentation for all ActionSet fixes available in GenHub for Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour.

## Overview

ActionSets are automated fixes that resolve common issues with Command & Conquer: Generals and Zero Hour on modern Windows systems. Each fix addresses specific compatibility, performance, or functionality problems.

## Critical Fixes

These fixes are essential for the games to run properly on modern Windows systems.

### BrowserEngineFix

**Purpose**: Fixes in-game browser compatibility issues by disabling the problematic BrowserEngine.dll.

## Technical Details

### ActionSet Framework

All fixes implement the `IActionSet` interface and inherit from `BaseActionSet`:

```csharp
public interface IActionSet
{
    string Id { get; }
    string Title { get; }
    string Description { get; }
    bool IsCoreFix { get; }
    bool IsCrucialFix { get; }

    Task<bool> IsApplicableAsync(GameInstallation installation);
    Task<bool> IsAppliedAsync(GameInstallation installation);
    Task<ActionSetResult> ApplyAsync(GameInstallation installation, IProgress<double>? progress, CancellationToken ct);
    Task<ActionSetResult> UndoAsync(GameInstallation installation, IProgress<double>? progress, CancellationToken ct);
}
```

### Result Pattern

All fixes return `ActionSetResult` with the following structure:

```csharp
public record ActionSetResult(bool Success, string? ErrorMessage = null);
```

- `Success`: Indicates whether the fix was applied successfully
- `ErrorMessage`: Optional error message if the fix failed

### Dependency Injection

All fixes are registered as singletons in the DI container:

```csharp
services.AddSingleton<IActionSet, BrowserEngineFix>();
services.AddSingleton<IActionSet, DbgHelpFix>();
// ... etc
```

### Game Installation Model

Fixes receive a `GameInstallation` object containing:

```csharp
public class GameInstallation
{
    public bool HasGenerals { get; }
    public bool HasZeroHour { get; }
    public string GeneralsPath { get; }
    public string ZeroHourPath { get; }
    // ... other properties
}
```

## Common Patterns

### File Replacement Pattern

Used by fixes that replace files (e.g., DbgHelpFix):

1. Check if target file exists
2. Backup original file to `.bak`
3. Copy/extract new file
4. Verify new file exists
5. For undo: restore from backup

### Registry Fix Pattern

Used by fixes that modify registry (e.g., EAAppRegistryFix):

1. Check if key/value exists
2. Read current value (for undo)
3. Write new value
4. Verify write succeeded
5. Store original value for undo

### INI File Pattern

Used by fixes that modify INI files (e.g., OptionsINIFix):

1. Load INI file using `IGameSettingsService`
2. Apply optimal settings
3. Save modified INI file
4. For undo: restore original values

### Download and Install Pattern

Used by fixes that download and install software (e.g., VCRedist2010Fix):

1. Check if software is already installed
2. Download installer to temp directory
3. Execute with silent flags
4. Wait for completion
5. Verify installation
6. Clean up temp files

---

## Troubleshooting

### Fix Not Applying

If a fix fails to apply:

1. Check the logs for detailed error messages
2. Ensure you have administrator privileges
3. Verify game installation paths are correct
4. Check that required dependencies are installed
5. Try running the fix again

### Fix Cannot Be Undone

Some fixes cannot be undone:

- Official patches (Patch104Fix, Patch108Fix)
- Software installations (VCRedist2010Fix, DirectXRuntimeFix)
- Folder creation (MyDocumentsPathCompatibility)

### Informational Fixes

Informational fixes provide guidance but don't make changes:

- Check the logs for detailed instructions
- Follow the step-by-step guidance provided
- Some fixes require manual configuration in third-party software
