# Uploading API Documentation

This document describes the Uploading API, Cloudflare Worker proxy gateway, and the `UploadThingService` implementation used for cloud storage.

## Overview

GenHub provides cross-platform cloud sharing for maps, replays, and custom game profile packages via a trusted serverless gateway proxy (Cloudflare Worker). The gateway isolates the master `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` server-side and issues stateless cryptographic HMAC deletion tokens to clients upon upload.

## Security Architecture

1. **Zero Client-Side Master Secrets**: The global master `UPLOADTHING_TOKEN` is stored exclusively in the Cloudflare Worker's encrypted environment variables. It is never compiled into client binaries or exposed in public API responses.
2. **Stateless HMAC Deletion Receipts**: When an upload is prepared, the gateway generates a signed deletion capability:
   $$\text{DeleteToken} = \text{FileKey} \mathbin{\Vert} \text{Timestamp} \mathbin{\Vert} \text{HMAC-SHA256}(\text{FileKey} \mathbin{\Vert} \text{Timestamp}, \text{GATEWAY\_SECRET})$$
   Only the client that originally uploaded the file receives this token. To delete a file, the client must present this token to `POST /api/v1/uploads/delete`, preventing arbitrary or unauthorized deletions.
3. **Gateway Multipart Proxying**: Clients post multipart form-data directly to `POST /api/v1/uploads`. The gateway verifies headers, file extension, and size, then forwards the file to UploadThing storage via UTApi and signs an HMAC deletion receipt.
4. **Allowed File Extensions**: The gateway strictly validates file extensions, permitting only `.zip`, `.rep` (replays), `.map` (map archives), and `.ghprofile` (game profile packages).
5. **Size Limit Validation**: The gateway enforces a strict 10 MB per-file upload limit independently of extension validation.

## IUploadThingService Interface

Located in `GenHub.Core.Interfaces.Services`, this interface provides upload and deletion capabilities returning strongly typed `OperationResult<T>` records:

```csharp
public interface IUploadThingService
{
    /// <summary>
    /// Uploads a file through the gateway and returns the upload result including public URL and deletion token.
    /// </summary>
    Task<OperationResult<UploadResult>> UploadFileAsync(
        string filePath,
        IProgress<double>? progress = null,
        CancellationToken ct = default);

    /// <summary>
    /// Deletes a file from cloud storage using its cryptographic deletion token.
    /// </summary>
    Task<OperationResult<bool>> DeleteFileAsync(
        string fileKey,
        string deleteToken,
        CancellationToken ct = default);
}
```

## Dependency Injection

The `UploadThingModule` configures `HttpClient` and registers `IUploadThingService` along with `IUploadHistoryService`:

```csharp
public static IServiceCollection AddUploadThingServices(this IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddHttpClient<IUploadThingService, UploadThingService>(static client =>
    {
        client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(2);
        client.DefaultRequestHeaders.UserAgent.ParseAdd(ApiConstants.DefaultUserAgent);
    });

    services.TryAddSingleton<IUploadHistoryService, UploadHistoryService>();

    return services;
}
```

## Constants

Defined in `GenHub.Core.Constants.ApiConstants`:
- `DefaultUploadGatewayBaseUrl`: `"https://genhub-upload-gateway.mustafa2146.workers.dev"`
- `UploadEndpoint`: `"/api/v1/uploads"`
- `UploadDeleteEndpoint`: `"/api/v1/uploads/delete"`
- `UploadThingPublicUrlFormat`: `"https://utfs.io/f/{0}"`
- `UploadThingUrlFragment`: `"utfs.io/f/"`
- `MediaTypeZip`: `"application/zip"`

## Local Content Profile Sharing Integration (PR #400 & PR #412)

When users share game profiles that contain local-only content (custom unindexed maps, bespoke mod patches, or local test build game clients), the local content must be packaged and uploaded so recipients can download it:

1. **Quota Management & User Warning**: UploadThing provides a 10 MB temporary storage pool per user (14-day retention). If active uploads exceed 10 MB, tool export interfaces alert the user and offer immediate one-click deletion of older uploads via the upload history flyout.
2. **Provenance & Link Expiration**: Importers inspect dependencies before download. If an author's temporary UploadThing link has expired (HTTP 404/410), GenHub displays an explicit, actionable notification asking the user to request an updated share link from the author.

## Uploads & Cloud Storage History Management

Built into the **Replay Manager** and **Map Manager** tool views (with a unified Settings page on the roadmap), users can:
- View live upload history across Replays, Maps, and Profile packages with category badges.
- Copy public share URLs with 1 click.
- Delete individual uploads immediately using HMAC `DeleteToken` receipts.
- Clear local history records.

## Future Storage Roadmap: Publisher Studio (PR #269) & Google Drive

When **Publisher Studio (PR #269)** is integrated:
- Users can authenticate their Google account via OAuth2 PKCE.
- Uploads can target the user's personal Google Drive folder, lifting the 10 MB UploadThing limitation and binding storage capacity directly to the user's Google Drive quota.
- Profile packages and local mods will generate public Google Drive download URLs with SHA-256 integrity verification upon import.
