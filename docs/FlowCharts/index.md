## Available Flowcharts

- **[Publisher Discovery Flow](./Publisher-Discovery-Flow.md)** - Dynamic publisher registration and content flow architecture
- **[Content Discovery Flow](./Discovery-Flow.md)** - How GenHub discovers content from multiple sources
- **[Content Resolution Flow](./Resolution-Flow.md)** - Converting discovered content into installable manifests

## Understanding the Diagrams

All flowcharts use Mermaid syntax for consistent rendering and maintainability. Key elements include:

- **Rectangles**: Process steps
- **Diamonds**: Decision points
- **Circles**: Service interfaces
- **Colored backgrounds**: Different system layers
- **Arrows**: Data/control flow

The diagrams are designed to be read from top to bottom, showing the progression through GenHub's layered architecture.
