## What is GeneralsHub?

- **Three-Tier Content Pipeline**: A robust system for discovering, resolving, acquiring, and assembling content from multiple sources
- **Workspace Strategies**: Multiple file assembly approaches (Full Copy, Symlink, Hybrid, Hard Link) for optimal performance and compatibility
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Native Windows and Linux support with platform-specific optimizations
